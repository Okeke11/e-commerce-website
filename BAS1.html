<h2 style="text-align: center;">📜Requirements for Being a Seller on the Marketplace</h2>

Let it serve as a comprehensive guide for all noble merchants who wish to trade within your digital kingdom.



<h3>🏷 1. Seller Account Registration</h3>

Before any merchant may sell their wares within the kingdom, they must first create a secure and verified seller account. This account is the foundation of their identity on the platform and shall contain essential information: <br>

<strong>a. Full Name </strong> <br>

The name must match the individual or legal entity responsible for the shop. It must not contain vulgar, misleading, or offensive terms. Accuracy is required for verification and potential legal communication. <br>

 <strong>b. Email Address</strong> <br>

The email address serves as the primary method of communication. It must be active, unique, and valid. Email verification may be conducted to ensure authenticity and to prevent duplication or fraud. All transactional notifications, system alerts, and buyer communications shall pass through this channel. <br>

 <strong>c. Password</strong> <br>

A strong password is required to protect the seller’s account. It must contain at least one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character. It is the sole responsibility of the seller to safeguard their login credentials. Sharing login access with unauthorized individuals is strictly prohibited. <br>

<strong>d. Shop Name </strong> <br>

The shop name is the public-facing title of the merchant’s store. It should reflect the nature of the goods being sold, be free from copyright infringement, and must not mislead buyers. Offensive or deceptive shop names will be rejected by the moderation council. <br>



<h3>🏬 2. Shop Setup and Verification </h3>

Once the account is created, the seller must proceed to configure their shop profile. This includes submitting required details, enabling buyers to understand and trust the brand. <br>

 <strong> a. Business Category</strong> <br>

Sellers must declare the category of products they intend to sell—be it fashion, electronics, home goods, health products, or digital services. Declaring the correct category ensures better visibility and proper indexing in search results. <br>

 <strong> b. Shop Logo and Banner (Optional but Recommended)</strong> <br>

A professional logo and shop banner elevate trust. Sellers are encouraged to upload high-resolution graphics that represent their brand identity. This increases buyer engagement and conveys legitimacy. <br>

 <strong> c. Legal Verification (if applicable)</strong> <br>

In certain regions or for certain product types, sellers may be required to submit proof of business registration, tax identification numbers, or licenses. These documents will be reviewed privately by the admin team and stored securely. <br>



 <h3>🧾 3. Product Listing Requirements</h3> 

Each product listed by the seller must adhere to specific guidelines to maintain marketplace quality and buyer satisfaction. <br>

 <strong>a. Clear Product Name and Description</strong> br

The product title should be concise and accurate. Descriptions must include key details such as size, color, weight, functionality, and any disclaimers. Sellers must avoid false advertising or exaggerated claims. <br>

 <strong> b. High-Quality Images</strong> <br>

Every product must be accompanied by at least **one** clear image. Multiple images (ideally from different angles) are encouraged. Images must be real representations of the actual product, not stock photos or misleading visuals. <br>

 <strong> c. Accurate Pricing and Stock Information</strong> <br> 

Prices must be clearly defined and reflect the total cost excluding shipping. Sellers must regularly update stock availability to avoid order cancellations. Repeated cancellations due to stock mismanagement may lead to suspension. <br>

 <strong> d. Product Legality and Appropriateness</strong> <br>

All items must comply with local laws and platform rules. Prohibited items include but are not limited to: weapons, illicit substances, counterfeit goods, and explicit materials. Sellers are solely responsible for ensuring their listings are lawful. <br>



 <h3>💳 4. Payment and Financial Requirements</h3>

Financial transparency and proper transaction handling are essential to uphold trust and marketplace order. <br>

 <strong> a. Payment Gateway Integration</strong> <br>

Sellers must be capable of receiving funds through the platform’s chosen payment gateway(s). This may require linking a verified bank account or digital wallet. <br>

<strong>  b. Commission Fees </strong> <br>

The marketplace may charge a commission per sale to cover operational costs. These fees will be automatically deducted before disbursing funds to the seller. Commission rates shall be disclosed transparently before onboarding. <br>

 <strong>c. Tax Obligations</strong> <br>

Sellers are responsible for declaring their income and paying any applicable taxes within their jurisdiction. The marketplace shall not be liable for a seller’s tax affairs. <br>

 <strong> d. Withdrawal Threshold and Schedule</strong> <br>

Payouts may only be made when a minimum balance is reached. Payment schedules will be predetermined—e.g., weekly or bi-weekly. Sellers must ensure their account information is correct to avoid withdrawal delays. <br>


<h3> 📦 5. Order Fulfillment and Delivery Management </h3>

Efficient and timely delivery of orders is a cornerstone of a seller’s reputation. <br>

 <strong> a. Timely Dispatch</strong> <br>

Sellers must ship out orders within the timeframe specified on their listings. Any delays must be communicated to the buyer with justification. <br>

<strong>b. Tracking and Updates</strong> <br>

If using a courier service, sellers must provide a tracking number. Buyers appreciate transparency and updates on the location of their goods. <br>

<strong>c. Packaging Standards</strong> <br>

Products must be packaged securely to prevent damage. Poor packaging leading to item breakage will be considered the seller's responsibility. <br>

<strong> d. Handling Returns and Refunds</strong> <br>

The marketplace may define a return policy, but sellers are expected to comply. In case of returns, sellers must process refunds promptly. Disputes may be escalated to platform administrators if unresolved. <br>



<h3> ⚖️ 6. Marketplace Code of Conduct</h3>

This noble kingdom upholds fairness, respect, and honesty among all merchants and buyers. <br>

<strong> a. Prohibited Behavior</strong> <br>

Sellers must refrain from:
<ul>
    <li>Deceptive pricing or product descriptions</li>
    <li>Threatening, abusive, or inappropriate language</li>
    <li>Manipulating reviews or ratings</li>

<strong>b. Fair Competition</strong> <br>

<strong> c. Communication Standards</strong> <br>

Sellers must respond to buyer inquiries professionally and within a reasonable time. Inactivity or unresponsiveness can negatively affect a seller’s rating. <br>



<h3>🛡 7. Security and Platform Integrity</h3>

The safety and integrity of the platform depend on sellers acting responsibly. <br>

<strong> a. Account Security</strong> <br>

Sellers must use secure passwords and avoid accessing their accounts from untrusted devices. Suspicious login attempts may result in temporary lockdowns. <br>

All activity is monitored for fraud or manipulation. If fraud is detected, the seller may face penalties including account suspension, withholding of funds, and legal action. <br>

<strong> c. Reporting Bugs or Vulnerabilities</strong> <br>
